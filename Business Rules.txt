Business Rules


1. 1 User ID per Account

2. A person can belong to multiple agencies, but must have a seperate ID for each agency. 
Two accounts with the same first name, last name, and email is fine because of the different User ID's.
Belonging to multiple agencies is rare. 


3. Must have every attribute listed in the "rad1 user .html" file. (user ID, first name, last name, address, email, VPN-Profile etc..)


4. Tickets are created anytime we fix a customers issue. Every user ID doesn't need a ticket. 


5. 1 certificate per account. jsmith's certificate and ksmith's certificate are not the same, 
even if they are using the same computer. 


6. Every account must have a change log, this is seperate from Tickets. Contains changes to account, not customer service calls
